# Multi‑Subnet Enterprise Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

##  Overview
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a multi‑subnet enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It includes VLAN segmentation, inter‑VLAN routing, DHCP services, and secure network structuring aligned with real-world enterprise environments.

---

##  Objectives
- Build a scalable multi‑subnet network  
- Configure VLANs for segmentation  
- Implement inter‑VLAN routing  
- Set up DHCP for dynamic IP allocation  
- Test connectivity and verify routing  

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco Routers & Switches  
- VLANs  
- DHCP  
- Static & dynamic routing  
- End devices (PCs, servers)

---

##  Key Skills Demonstrated
- Network design and topology planning  
- VLAN creation and trunking  
- Router-on-a-stick configuration  
- DHCP pool configuration  
- Subnetting and IP addressing  
- Troubleshooting with `ping`, `show` commands, and routing tables
