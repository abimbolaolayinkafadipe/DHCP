# Multi‑Subnet Enterprise Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a multi‑subnet enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It includes VLAN segmentation, inter‑VLAN routing, DHCP services, and secure network structuring aligned with real-world enterprise environments.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a scalable multi‑subnet network  
- Configure VLANs for segmentation  
- Implement inter‑VLAN routing  
- Set up DHCP for dynamic IP allocation  
- Test connectivity and verify routing  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco Routers & Switches  
- VLANs  
- DHCP  
- Static & dynamic routing  
- End devices (PCs, servers)
